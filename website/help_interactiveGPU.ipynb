        "The solution implemented by this tutorial does not allow launching SLURM jobs from within the VS code session on the CRNL cluster. But it will allow you to use the GPUs interactively. Drop me at message at [romain.ligneul@inserm.fr](romain.ligneul@inserm.fr) if you really need to launch slurm jobs from VS code (instead of launching them from Jupyter hub). A solution exists but it should be used mindfully.\n",

        "However, the straightforward usage of VScode on the cluster poses a **big collective problem**. Indeed, when you open a SSH session with VScode, you arrive in the so-called \"login node\" (currently node14 on the new server, and node12 on the old one). This node is not supposed to perform any computation, but instead to organise input-output, ssh connections, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if they do most of their computations using jobs submitted to SLURM, VScode users (I am amongst them) can still make (made!) the entire infrastructure crash by overloading the \"login node\". This is because every VScode user will open some notebook, load some data, call slurm from that same login node. So, when 10 or 20 of them are connected at the same time...\n",
