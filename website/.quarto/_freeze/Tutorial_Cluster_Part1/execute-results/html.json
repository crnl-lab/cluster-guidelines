This tutorial will help you to set up your personal environment if you use Python.\n\n\n\n\n{{< downloadthis www/Tutorial_Cluster_Part1.ipynb dname=\"Tutorial_Cluster_Part1.ipynb\" label=\"Download this notebook\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIf you are working on the CRNL cluster, you can find also the corresponding notebook at this location: `/crnldata/projets_communs/tutorials/`\n:::\n\n## Install miniconda to manage your virtual environment\n\nInstalling miniconda is not incompatible with using venv later on.\n\nOpen a terminal and type the following commands: <br> `cd ~`<br> `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`<br> `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`<br> `source ~/.bashrc`\n\nFollow the instructions and say yes to everything (you make press Ctrl+C once followed by Enter to skip the text faster)\n\nNB: In JupyterLab, you can open a new terminal at 'File-\\>New-\\>Terminal'. You can then bring this terminal just below your notebook by clicking on its tab and dragging it toward the lower part of the window.\n\n## Create your first conda environment\n\nStill in the terminal, type: <br> `conda create -n crnlenv python=3.9` <br> `conda activate crnlenv`\n\nThe crnlenv virtual environment is active! Everything that will be installed from now on will only be accessible when crnlenv has been activated\n\n## Make your conda environment visible to Jupyter lab\n\nStill in the terminal type: <br> `conda install ipykernel` <br> `python -m ipykernel install --user --name crnlenv --display-name \"Python (crnlenv)\"`\n\nThis commands allow your kernel to be accessed from Jupyter Lab, not only from the command line. If you create more conda environments / kernels, you will also have to run these lines\n\n## Populate your conda environment / kernel with essential tools\n\nInstall a package that allow to submit your jobs easily from any Jupyter notebook on Slurm<br> `conda install -c conda-forge submitit`\n\nInstall numpy <br> `conda install numpy`\n\nInstall a memory_profiler<br> `pip install memory_profiler -U`\n\nLater on you could install various other tools in your virtual environment, but the priority is to check that you can use the cluster and distribute your jobs.\n\nNB: if you wonder why install alternatively with conda or pip, the answer is: you can almost always do it with pip but if it works with conda, the package might be \"better\" installed in some case.\n\n## Let's start computing\n\nYou should be able to see the crnlenv in Jupyterlab if you go in \"Kernel-\\>Change Kernel\".\n\n**Select it** and then restart the kernel (\"Kernel-\\>Restart Kernel\") to continue this tutorial.\n\nOn the top right of this window, you should see something like \"Python (crnlenv)\". It means your notebook is running in the right virtual environment!\n\nFrom now on, you will execute the code cells below, in order. You can do it either by pressing the play button (at the top of the notebook) or by clicking in the target cell and pressing Shift+Enter.\n\nYou may also want to check the tutorials of the module [submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit) used here.\n\n::: {#4a679555 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n###### Import packages/modules\nimport submitit\n# memory profiler to evaluate how much your jobs demand\nfrom memory_profiler import memory_usage\n# import garbage collector: it is sometimes useful to trigger the garbage collector manually with gc.collect()\nimport gc\n# import other modules\nimport time\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#87402508 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n###### Define a function that should run on the cluster\n\n# this specific function is very dumb and only for demonstration purposes\n# we will just feed it with a number and a string, but we could pass any object to it (filepath, DataFrames, etc.)\n# here, the function only return one argument but it could return several (result result1, result2)\ndef yourFunction(argument1, argument2):\n\n    #
