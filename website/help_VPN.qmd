If you only want to use the cluster when you are at the lab, you don't need the VPN. 

The VPN is only required to access the CRNL servers from outside. You can only obtain it if you are a registered CRNL user.

You need your CRNL identifiers to access this internal page. Essentially, besides
installing the software, **you  will have to fill the PDF "[fiche](https://wiki.crnl.fr/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:informatique:inscription_service_vpn.pdf)"**
([here](https://wiki.crnl.fr/doku.php?id=wiki:informatique:services:vpn))
and send it to [thibaut.woog@inserm.fr](thibaut.woog@inserm.fr). Then, it
will be a matter of days before you can access the CRNL infrastructure
remotely. You'll be noticed by email.

If you don't have an INSERM email, you can ask one if you work at CRNL
(even if you are affiliated to CNRS or UCBL).
