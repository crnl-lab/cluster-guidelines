This website provides guidelines to use the cluster of the Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon (CRNL).

## Using Jupyter lab

Our new cluster has a built-in Jupyterhub system that will greatly facilitate the life of most users and ITs, as it helps managing the load on the "entry point" server (i.e. 10.69.168.93).
Jupyterhub offers to everyone a very complete IDE for Python and Matlab programming, as well as a Desktop application (similar to former VNC connections).

Yet, you will still need to learn how to create virtual environments (especially Python users) and how to submit jobs efficiently and ethically.

### Obtain VPN access (optional)

If you want to access the cluster remotely, check this [page](./help_VPN).

### Configure your Git (optional but recommended)

### Learn to submit jobs

The cluster uses SLURM to manage "jobs" (i.e. functions/scripts running in parallel). Check the two part tutorial for efficient and responsible job submission on the cluster using Slurm and Python (including interactive Notebooks).

## 
## 1- Get Git

Check the tutorial for [easy SSH access](./help_ssh) with SSH keys, to avoid having to enter passwords in the future.

## 2- Set up SSH and Visual Code

Check the tutorial for [easy SSH access](./help_ssh) with SSH keys, to avoid having to enter passwords in the future.
