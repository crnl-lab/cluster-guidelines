This website provides guidelines to use the cluster of the Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon (CRNL).

It is managed and it has been configured by Thibaut Woog ([thibaut.woog\@inserm.fr](mailto:thibaut.woog@inserm.fr)).

## Using Jupyter lab

Our new cluster has a **built-in Jupyterhub system that will greatly facilitate the life of most users** (and ITs!), as it helps managing the load on the "entry point" server (i.e. 10.69.168.93). Jupyterhub offers to everyone a very complete IDE for Python and Matlab programming, as well as a Desktop application (similar to former VNC connections).

The Jupyterhub environment is available at the following address (accessible within CRNL premises or with VPN):
[http://10.69.168.24:8000/](http://10.69.168.24:8000/)

Yet, you will still need to learn how to create virtual environments (especially Python users) and how to submit jobs efficiently and ethically.

### Obtain VPN access (optional)

If you want to access the cluster remotely, check this [page](./help_VPN).

### Configure your Github (optional but recommended)

Learn how to connect your Github account to your terminal on the cluster [here](./help_github).

### Learn to submit jobs (recommended)

The cluster uses SLURM to manage "jobs" (i.e. functions/scripts running in parallel). Check the two part tutorial for efficient and responsible job submission on the cluster using Slurm and Python (including interactive Notebooks).

[Part 1](./Tutorial_Cluster_Part1)

[Part 2](./Tutorial_Cluster_Part2)

## Using VS code

Check the [dedicated tutorial](./help_VScode) to use VS code within contained SLURM jobs, to avoid cluttering/saturating our login node (a common cause of institute-wise service disruption).

Note that the job submission tutorial is still applicable when using VS code.

## How to contribute
