To transfer and manage folders/files on the cluster, you can use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

Simply install it. Then, in Site Manager, create a new site (give it the name CRNLcluster, for example) and set the following:

### Option 1

-   Host: 10.69.168.93
-   Protocol: SFTP
-   Logon type: "Ask for password"
-   User: your cluster username (probably firstname.lastname)

### Option 2

If you completed the SSH [tutorial](./help_ssh){target="_blank"}.

-   Host: 10.69.168.93
-   Protocol: SFTP
-   Logon type: "Keyfile"
-   User: your cluster username (probably firstname.lastname)
-   Key file: path to the private SSH key created during the tutorial (e.g. crnlcluster)

Note that, by default, Filezilla might force you to select a .ppk file. To select your private key that has no extension, you will need to change the .ppk file filter to "All files".

## Good sides of Filezilla

When using the cluster, you might sometimes struggle with Files and Folders authorizations. Those can be set in the command line with `chmod`, but Filezilla can do it for you in a more intuitive way. Just right click on any folder and select "File permissions..."

Another good side is that you can apply filters to upload/download files in batch, including or excluding files according to specific criteria (types, sizes, etc.). Check "View -\> Directory Listing Filters".
