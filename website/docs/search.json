    "text": "Sharing the resources\nBecause it needs to remain highly flexible and adapted to a wide range of needs, the cluster is not very constrained with respect to resource allocation.\nIf you do not pay attention, you might monopolize all the CPUs or all the memory with your jobs, without leaving anything behind for your colleagues.\nThat why evaluating the amount of memory you need and the maximum time that a non-bugged job might take is important! Based on this information, you can adjust mem_gb and timeout_min (timeout in minutes) well.\nSimilarly, you may need to decide how many CPUs will be useful for you. Can you go with only one without losing much? Then use only 1. Do you divide your computation time by a huge factor if you use more, then use more. But how will you know?\nWhat follows should help you with all this.\n\nAnticipating time & memory consumption\nHereafter, we use memory_usage() which has a slighty unusual way of passing arguments to its target function. All positional arguments (those without an = sign in the def) are passed together, and all non-positional arguments (also called key-value pairs) are passed together. For example, we could try: mem_usage=memory_usage((somefunc,(0.1,4,0.88), {'file' : 'whatever.csv','index' : 0 }))  If we had a function defined like this:  somefunc(a,b,c, file=None, index=-1)\n\n###### simple memory/time check\nfrom memory_profiler import memory_usage\nimport time\n\n# define a single thread function\ndef duplicate_ones(a, n=100, x=0):\n    import time\n    time.sleep(1)\n    b = [a] * n\n    b = [a] * n\n    b = [a] * n\n    time.sleep(1)\n    return b\n\n# duplicate ones a million time\nprint('Duplicate ones a thousand times')\nstart_time = time.time()\nmem_usage=memory_usage((duplicate_ones,(1,), {'n' : int(1e3)}))\nend_time = time.time()\nprint('Maximum memory usage (in MB): %s' % max(mem_usage))\nprint('Maximum memory usage (in GB): %s' % (max(mem_usage)/1000))\nprint('Time taken (in s): %s' % (end_time-start_time))\n\n# duplicate ones 100 million times\nprint('Duplicate ones a million time')\nstart_time = time.time()\nmem_usage=memory_usage((duplicate_ones,(1,), {'n' : int(1e8)}))\nend_time = time.time()\nprint('Maximum memory usage (in MB): %s' % max(mem_usage))\nprint('Maximum memory usage (in GB): %s' % (max(mem_usage)/1000))\nprint('Time taken (in s): %s' % (end_time-start_time))\n\nprint('Do you notice the difference in time and memory due to the change in duplication size?')\n\n\n\nEvaluating CPU count needs\nHow to evaluate whether our job will benefit from having more CPU available to them? If you don’t know whether your function use parallelization or not, because you relies on high-level toolboxes, then you can evaluate that empirically by looking at the time your jobs take depending on the number of CPUs you allow.\nLet’s try first with our last function. It should take about 10s to run.\n\nimport os \nimport submitit\n\n# these commands may not be necessary but helped overcoming an error initially\nos.environ['SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK'] = str(1)\nos.environ['SLURM_TRES_PER_TASK'] = os.environ['SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK']\n    \n# cpu counts to test\nnCPUs_totest=[1, 4]\n\n# loop over cpu counts\njcount=0\njoblist=[]\nstart_time = time.time()\nfor i, cpus in enumerate(nCPUs_totest):\n    executor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder=os.getcwd()+'/tuto_logs/')\n    executor.update_parameters(mem_gb=4, timeout_min=5, slurm_partition=\"CPU\", cpus_per_task=cpus)\n    job = executor.submit(duplicate_ones, 1, int(1e8))\n    job.n_cpus=cpus\n    print(\"job with \" + str(job.n_cpus) + \" cpus submitted\")\n    joblist.append(job)\n    jcount=jcount+1\n\n# wait for job completion\nnjobs_finished = sum(job.done() for job in joblist)\nwhile njobs_finished&lt;jcount:\n    doneIdx=-1\n    time.sleep(1)\n    for j, job in enumerate(joblist):\n        if job.done():\n            doneIdx=j\n            break\n    if doneIdx&gt;=0:\n        print(str(njobs_finished)+' on ' + str(jcount))\n        # report last job finished\n        print(\"job with \" + str(job.n_cpus) + \" cpus returned in \" + str(time.time()-start_time) + \" seconds\")\n        joblist.pop(doneIdx)\n        njobs_finished=njobs_finished+1\n\nprint('### Do you think that increasing the number of CPUs made a big difference? ###')\n\nNow let’s redo exactly the same thing, with a numpy function that may benefit from multiple CPUs (i.e. np.dot).\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\ndef mat_multiply(size):\n  # Generate large random matrices\n  A = np.random.rand(size, size)\n  B = np.random.rand(size, size)\n\n  # Measure time for matrix multiplication\n  C = np.dot(A, B)\n  \n  return 'this function does not return anything special'\n  \nos.environ['SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK'] = str(1)\nos.environ['SLURM_TRES_PER_TASK'] = os.environ['SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK']\n\n# cpu counts to test\nnCPUs_totest=[4, 4, 4, 1]\n\n# define the max number of jobs that may run in parallel\nmaxjobs=2\n\n# loop over cpu counts\njcount=0\njoblist=[]\nstart_time = time.time()\nfor i, cpus in enumerate(nCPUs_totest):\n    executor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder=os.getcwd()+'/tuto_logs/')\n    executor.update_parameters(mem_gb=4, timeout_min=5, slurm_partition=\"CPU\", cpus_per_task=cpus)\n    # check how many job are running (not done) and wait it they exceed our limit\n    while sum(not job.done() for job in joblist)&gt;maxjobs:\n        print('wait to submit new job')\n        time.sleep(3)\n    job = executor.submit(mat_multiply, 8000)\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    job.n_cpus=cpus\n    print(\"job with \" + str(job.n_cpus) + \" cpus submitted\")\n    joblist.append(job)\n    jcount=jcount+1\n\n# wait for job completion\nnjobs_finished = 0; \nwhile njobs_finished&lt;jcount:\n    doneIdx=-1\n    time.sleep(1)\n    for j, job in enumerate(joblist):\n        if job.done():\n            doneIdx=j\n            break\n    if doneIdx&gt;=0:\n        print(str(njobs_finished)+' on ' + str(jcount))\n        # report last job finished and print stats\n        print(\"job with \" + str(job.n_cpus) + \" cpus returned in \" + str(time.time()-start_time) + \" seconds\")\n        print(\"job status: \" + job.state)\n        joblist.pop(doneIdx)\n        njobs_finished=njobs_finished+1\n\nprint('\\n### Do you think that increasing the number of CPUs made a big difference? ###')\n\n\n\nScaling up responsibly\nIn the loop above, you might have noticed something new: we’ve implemented another good practice by self-limiting the number of jobs we will run in parallel on the cluster. Indeed, it might be ok to launch 40 or even 100 parallel jobs if you are in a hurry, but the amount of CPUs in the cluster is not infinite, and neither is the amount of memory.\nNumber of CPUs: you can get this information by running sinfo -o%C in your terminal, or !sinfo -o%C in the notebook. The CPU partitions have about 350 cores available at the time of writing Amount of memory: you can see this by running sinfo -o \"%P %n %m\" in your terminal (or with a ! in the notebook). The CPU partitions have about 2.3TB of memory at the time of writing.\nIf it is a sunday and nobody is using the cluster, it is probably fine to increase maxjobs to 100 or more (note that if you require 4 cpu per task, it means that you are actually requiring 400 cpus overall!). But if it is 10.30pm on a tuesday, using this parameter might be the same as walking to the coffee machine and taking all the coffee reserves to your office! So, take the habit of setting your maxjobs-like parameter on a daily basis after checking sinfo -o%C.\n\n# check node and CPU information\nprint(\"### Node counts: \\nA: currently in use \\B available\")\n!sinfo -o%A\nprint(\"### CPU counts: \\nA: core currently in use \\nI: available \\nO: unavailable (maintenance, down, etc) \\nT: total\")\n!sinfo -o%C\n\n# check some stats of our last job\nprint('### CPU time and MaxRSS of our last job (about 1000Mb should be added to your MaxRSS (Mb) in order to cover safely the memory needs of the python runtime)###')\nos.system(f'sacct -j {job.job_id} --format=\"CPUTime,MaxRSS\"')\n\n\n\nA more compact approach\nIn the above examples, we have decomposed most operations using for loops in order to illustrate the different concepts. But with more advanced methods we can compact a lot the code used.\nThe example below (adapted from submitit documentation) allows getting rid of the job submission loop and directly map our input arrays to job submissions, using executor.map_array and some asynchronous operations. Note that such compact approach might be more difficult to debug.\n\nimport asyncio\n\n# just add a/b, multiply by c and wait for b seconds\ndef simple_function(a, b, c):\n    output=(a + b)*c\n    time.sleep(b)\n    return output\n\n# define arrays matched in length for the iteration (if you have constant parameters, you can always duplicate them as done with \"c\" below)\na = [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nb = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 10]\nc=[0.1]*len(b)\n\n# make sure our arrays are matched in length\nassert len(a)==len(b)==len(c)\n\n# prepare executor\nexecutor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder=os.getcwd()+'/tuto_logs/')\n\n# define maxjobs to a low value to illustrate\nmaxjobs=3\n\n# add the maxjobs argument\nexecutor.update_parameters(slurm_array_parallelism=maxjobs, mem_gb=2, timeout_min=4, slurm_partition=\"CPU\", cpus_per_task=1)\n\n# execute the job (note the .map_array command that different from the .submit command used above)\njobs = executor.map_array(simple_function, a, b, c)  # just a list of jobs\n\n# print results as they become available\nfor aws in asyncio.as_completed([j.awaitable().result() for j in jobs]):\n    result = await aws\n    print(\"result of computation: \" + str(result))\n\n# note that we use here an asynchronous method based on asyncio\n# it essential do something similar to what we were doing after \n# \"# wait for job completion\", but in a much more compact way\n# however, the reordering of outputs wrt to inputs is not implemented\n\n\n\nSubmitting and going home\nOften, when we have very long jobs, we want to submit these jobs, go home and come back the next day or the next week to check the results of their computations.\nIn this case, we should not expect our notebook to be still alive when we come back. Instead, we should adopt the more standard approach of writing down our results and load them in a new jupyter session afterwards!\nThis is what we illustrate in the final example below.\n\n# write in job_output within our directory\njob_output_folder=os.getcwd()+'/tuto_output/'\n\n# make sure our output folder exists\nif not os.path.exists(job_output_folder):\n  os.makedirs(job_output_folder)\n\n# just add a/b, multiply by c, wait for b seconds and write down the result to an output folder (c)\ndef simple_function_write(a, b, c):\n    output=(a + b)\n    time.sleep(b)\n    output_filepath=os.path.join(c, str(a) + '_' + str(b) + '.txt')\n    with open(output_filepath, 'w') as file:\n      file.write(f'{a}\\n')\n      file.write(f'{b}\\n')\n    \n# define arrays matched in length for the iteration (if you have constant parameters, you can always duplicate them as done with \"c\" below)\na = [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nb = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 10]\nc=[job_output_folder]*len(b)\n\n# make sure our arrays are matched in length\nassert len(a)==len(b)==len(c)\n\n# prepare executor\nexecutor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder=\"tuto_logs\")\n\n# define maxjobs to a low value to illustrate\nmaxjobs=3\n\n# pass parameter to the executor\nexecutor.update_parameters(slurm_array_parallelism=maxjobs, mem_gb=2, timeout_min=4, slurm_partition=\"CPU\", cpus_per_task=1)\n\n# execute the job (note the .map_array command that different from the .submit command used above)\njobs = executor.map_array(simple_function_write, a, b, c)  # just a list of jobs\nprint('### all jobs submitted ###')\nprint('the kernel will now be killed (and your notebook will crash) but you can see that your jobs keep running by typing squeue in the terminal')\nprint('crucially, the content of tuto_output/ will still be updated in the background!')\n\n# wait a little and kill manually the kernel process\ntime.sleep(3)\nos.system('kill ' + str(os.getpid()))\n\nIt is a good practice to run os.system('kill ' + str(os.getpid())) if you don’t need to use the notebook anymore. Simply closing it may not interrupt the process and free the resources for the other users."

Instead, we should adopt the more standard approach of writing down our results and load them in a new jupyter session afterwards!\nThis is what we illustrate in the final example below.\n\n# write in job_output within our directory\njob_output_folder=os.getcwd()+'/tuto_output/'\n\n# make sure our output folder exists\nif not os.path.exists(job_output_folder):\n  os.makedirs(job_output_folder)\n\n# just add a/b, multiply by c, wait for b seconds and write down the result to an output folder (c)\ndef simple_function_write(a, b, c):\n    output=(a + b)\n    time.sleep(b)\n    output_filepath=os.path.join(c, str(a) + '_' + str(b) + '.txt')\n    with open(output_filepath, 'w') as file:\n      file.write(f'{a}\\n')\n      file.write(f'{b}\\n')\n    \n# define arrays matched in length for the iteration (if you have constant parameters, you can always duplicate them as done with \"c\" below)\na = [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nb = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 10]\nc=[job_output_folder]*len(b)\n\n# make sure our arrays are matched in length\nassert len(a)==len(b)==len(c)\n\n# prepare executor\nexecutor = submitit.AutoExecutor(folder=\"tuto_logs\")\n\n# define maxjobs to a low value to illustrate\nmaxjobs=3\n\n# pass parameter to the executor\nexecutor.update_parameters(slurm_array_parallelism=maxjobs, mem_gb=2, timeout_min=4, slurm_partition=\"CPU\", cpus_per_task=1)\n\n# execute the job (note the .map_array command that different from the .submit command used above)\njobs = executor.map_array(simple_function_write, a, b, c)  # just a list of jobs\nprint('### all jobs submitted ###')\nprint('the kernel will now be killed (and your notebook will crash) but you can see that your jobs keep running by typing squeue in the terminal')\nprint('crucially, the content of tuto_output/ will still be updated in the background!')\n\n# wait a little and kill manually the kernel process\ntime.sleep(3)\nos.system('kill ' + str(os.getpid()))\n\nIt is a good practice to run os.system('kill ' + str(os.getpid())) if you don’t need to use the notebook anymore. Simply closing it may not interrupt the process and free the resources for the other users."

However, you can allocate multiple cpus and use your own parallel code (e.g. multiprocessing or joblib in Python). Drop me at message at romain.ligneul@inserm.fr if you really need to launch slurm jobs from VS code (instead of launching them from Jupyter hub). A solution exists but it should be used mindfully.\nVScode is a very potent IDE that is used by many people, including at the CRNL.\nHowever, the straightforward usage of VScode on the cluster poses a big collective problem. Indeed, when you open a SSH session with VScode, you arrive in the so-called “login node” (currently node14 on the new server, and node12 on the old one). This node is not supposed to perform any computation, but instead to organise input-output, ssh connections, etc.\nEven if they do most of their computations using jobs submitted to SLURM, VScode users (I am amongst them) can still make (made!) the entire infrastructure crash by overloading the “login node”. This is because every VScode user will open some notebook, load some data, call slurm from that same login node. So, when 10 or 20 of them are connected at the same time…\n💥\nFortunately, a simple solution exists and this tutorial will guide you through it."

In the long run they will help you to save a lot of time, if you use VS code, Filezilla or any other SSH based connection.\nFind your local .ssh folder (local always refer to the computer you are using).\nOn Linux, you can probably find it at ~/.ssh/ or /home/username/.ssh/.\nOn Window, you can probably find at at C:\\Users\\username\\.ssh\\.\nIf you don’t find it, just create it and cd in it. Then type:\nssh-keygen -f crnlcluster\nFollow the instructions. If you want to use a passphrase, keep it short. Otherwise press Enter to skip entering a passphrase. Then type: type crnlcluster.pub\nYou public key will appear in the terminal. Keep it open.\nNow, type:\nssh cluster_username@10.69.168.93\nChange cluster_username to match your username on the cluster (typically, firstname.lastname)\nYou will be asked to enter your CRNL password (the same you use to enter in the wiki.crnl.fr and to open Jupyter lab sessions).\nNow, you are logged in the cluster!\nThe next step is to make your public SSH key file know from the cluster. To do so, you can either use the cluster command line (a bit tricky), use Filezilla or VS code."
